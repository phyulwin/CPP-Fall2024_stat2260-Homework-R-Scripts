# Given data

s <- 3.79       # sample standard deviation

# Confidence level

# Find the critical t-value for 85% confidence level and 143 degrees of freedom (n-1)
alpha <- 1 - confidence_level

# Calculate the margin of error

# Construct the confidence interval

# Given data for sample size calculation

# Calculate the critical z-value for 85% confidence level (normal distribution)
