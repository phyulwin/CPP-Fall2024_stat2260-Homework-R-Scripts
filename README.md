# Regression Analysis for Health and Lifestyle Data

### **Project Overview:**

This project explores the relationship between lifestyle factors and health scores using regression analysis. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes variables such as BMI, exercise frequency, diet quality, sleep hours, smoking status, and alcohol consumption, with **Health Score** as the target variable.

### **Objective:**

The goal is to identify how different lifestyle factors predict an individualâ€™s health score and build a regression model for predictions. The analysis focuses on understanding the influence of predictors like Diet Quality, BMI, and Sleep Hours on health.

### **Key Findings:**

* **Diet Quality** was found to be the strongest predictor of Health Score, followed by BMI.
* Models were compared using **R-squared** and **AIC** values, with a multi-variable model (Diet Quality + BMI) outperforming simpler models.
* The best model explained **62.83%** of the variance in Health Score, providing a more accurate prediction than a single predictor model.

### **Conclusion:**

Diet Quality and BMI are significant predictors of health, and incorporating both leads to a better overall model for predicting health outcomes.
